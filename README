xlsh - eXtended Login Shell
(c) 2011 Micha≈Ç Siejak

A simple login shell with readline functionality and PAM integration.
 * When run stand-alone on a virtual console it can replace standard "login" program.
 * When run in cooperation with X daemon component (xlshd) it can replace XDM/GDM/KDM.

Features:
 * Small and simple, written entirely in C.
 * Easily hackable because of compact codebase (~950 source lines).
 * Uses PAM for authorization and session management.
 * Entirely keyboard driven display manager replacement (when used with xlshd)
   without the need for any fat libraries or GUI toolkits.
 * Defaults configured before compilation, some of them can be changed by
   setting few environment variables.
 * Single shell script file (/etc/xlsh/xlshrc) for customizing how
   xlshd launches xlsh.
 * Introduces a concept of "pre-login shell" known from GNU/HURD.
 * Only *three* important commands: 'login', 'reboot' and 'shutdown'.
 * New commands can be easily added (if you need any) by editing xlsh.c
 * Username autocompletion on TAB.
 * Zenburn color scheme (when run under X).

The only build dependencies are: make, a decent C compiler, libreadline and libpam.
Configuration options can be edited in include/config.h before compiling.
